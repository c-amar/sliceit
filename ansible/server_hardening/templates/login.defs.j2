# Please note that the parameters in this configuration file control the
# behavior of the tools from the shadow-utils component. None of these
# tools uses the PAM mechanism, and the utilities that use PAM (such as the
# passwd command) should therefore be configured elsewhere. Refer to
# /etc/pam.d/system-auth for more information.

# *REQUIRED*
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define both, MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#   QMAIL_DIR is for Qmail
#
#QMAIL_DIR      Maildir
MAIL_DIR        /var/spool/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail

# Enable logging and display of `/var/log/faillog` login failure info. This option conflicts with the `pam_tally` PAM module.
FAILLOG_ENAB      yes

# Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are recorded.
#
# *WARNING*: Unknown usernames may become world readable. See #290803 and #298773 for details about how this could become a security concern
LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB  no

# Enable logging of successful logins
LOG_OK_LOGINS     yes

# Enable "syslog" logging of su activity - in addition to sulog file logging.
SYSLOG_SU_ENAB    yes

# Enable "syslog" logging of newgrp and sg.
SYSLOG_SG_ENAB    yes

# If defined, login failures will be logged here in a utmp format last, when invoked as lastb, will read `/var/log/btmp`, so...
FTMP_FILE         /var/log/btmp

# If defined, the command name to display when running "su -".  For # example, if this is defined as "su" then a "ps" will display the command is "-su".  If not defined, then "ps" would display the name of the shell actually being run, e.g. something like "-sh".
SU_NAME           su

# *REQUIRED*: The default PATH settings, for superuser and normal users. (they are minimal, add the rest in the shell startup files)

# Terminal permissions
# --------------------

# Login tty will be assigned this group ownership.
# If you have a "write" program which is "setgid" to a special group which owns the terminals, define `TTYGROUP` to the group number and `TTYPERM` to `0620`.  Otherwise leave `TTYGROUP` commented out and assign `TTYPERM` to either `622` or `600`.
TTYGROUP          tty

# Login tty will be set to this permission.
# In Debian `/usr/bin/bsd-write` or similar programs are setgid tty. However, the default and recommended value for `TTYPERM` is still `0600` to not allow anyone to write to anyone else console or terminal
# Users can still allow other people to write them by issuing the `mesg y` command.
TTYPERM           0600

# Login conf initializations
# --------------------------

# Terminal ERASE character ('\010' = backspace). Only used on System V.
ERASECHAR         0177

# Terminal KILL character ('\025' = CTRL/U). Only used on System V.
KILLCHAR          025

# The default umask value for `pam_umask` and is used by useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.
# If `USERGROUPS_ENAB` is set to `yes`, that will modify this `UMASK` default value for private user groups, i. e. the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name: for these, the user permissions will be used as group permissions, e. g. `022` will become `002`.
# Prefix these values with `0` to get octal, `0x` to get hexadecimal.
# `022` is the "historical" value in Debian for UMASK
# `027`, or even `077`, could be considered better for privacy.
UMASK             077

# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits (examples: `022` -> `002`, `077` -> `007`) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
# If set to yes, userdel will remove the userÂ´s group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user.
USERGROUPS_ENAB   yes

# Max number of login retries if password is bad. This will most likely be overriden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module has it's own built in of 3 retries. However, this is a safe fallback in case you are using an authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.
LOGIN_RETRIES     5

# Max time in seconds for login
LOGIN_TIMEOUT     60


# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?
